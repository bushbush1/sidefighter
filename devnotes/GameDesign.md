Game Design Document
1. Game Overview
Game Name: (TBD)

One-liner:
A small platformer/side-scroller combat game where you fight some basic enemies before reaching a boss.

Goal:
To win, you must kill the boss.

2. Core Mechanics
Player Movement:
Move left, right, jump, and attack.

Physics:
Gravity, collisions with platforms and ground.

Combat:
Left click to attack.

Enemies:
Super basic AI: move left for a short period, then right for a short period.

3. Level Planning
Initially, while learning, stick to one level, especially since I have no skills in creating assets or art.

Level will use basic blocks for ground and possibly one or two moving platforms to jump on, nothing too complex.

Start with one or two enemies, eventually add a boss (likely the hardest part).

The game ends when all enemies are killed, the boss is defeated, the player dies, or potentially a timer runs out.

4. Visuals
No art yet â€” start with simple blocks and shapes for player, enemies, and platforms.

No sprites or tilemaps at this stage due to lack of art/sprite skills.

5. Future Features
Player and enemy health bars.

Game music and sound effects.

Different enemy types.

Player knockback or upgrades/power-ups.

Simple boss attack patterns.

Win and loss screens.

maybe some different attacks or weapons etc.
