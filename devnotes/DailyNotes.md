2. decided on the basic features that I am planning on implementing for a minimal viable game. (MVG)
3. spent about 1-2 hours working on it
**total hours = 1 and 1/2**

Day two (21/7/25):
1. **time spent working = 1-2.30 = 1 and 1/2**
2. **what did i do**:
- did some reasearch into enemies and their movement etc as i have never worked with this before. 
- watched a couple videos online. Did some research into running the game from the terminal so i dont have to drag and drop the main file onto the exc everytime i want to run the game. 
- did some research into the best study patterns etc so i can plan ahead etc.
3. 

Day Three (22/07/25)
1. **Time spent working (9am-10am, 1.30pm - 2.45, 4pm -)**
2. **what did i do** - did some basic research into tiled and map creation. watched a video on this. tried to create a test map using tiled and importing it into vs code to use as a map. currently the sizing is a bit weird but will try figure that out later in the day or another day. tried some time finding sprites and then attempting to create the animations for these 
3. **what didnt work/struggled with** - today i struggled with the animation of the character sprites. the sheet the tutorial used had all directions on one sprit sheet where i have multiple sheets. i manged to make some progress on this issue, by flipping the sprite but it still looks super jenk....


Total time spent = 3 hours
