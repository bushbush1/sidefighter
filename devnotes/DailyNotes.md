Daily Developer notes:
**taking daily notes on what i did, what worked, what didnt and how much time i spent working on my project**

Day one (20/7/25):
1. did some basic planing and setting up as much of my dev environment as i could.
2. decided on the basic features that I am planning on implementing for a minimal viable game. (MVG)
3. spent about 1-2 hours working on it
**total hours = 1hour 30 mins**

Day two (21/7/25):
1. **time spent working = 1-2.30 = 1hour 30 mins**
2. **what did i do**:
- did some reasearch into enemies and their movement etc as i have never worked with this before. 
- watched a couple videos online. Did some research into running the game from the terminal so i dont have to drag and drop the main file onto the exc everytime i want to run the game. 
- did some research into the best study patterns etc so i can plan ahead etc.
3. 

Day Three (22/07/25)
1. **Time spent working (9am-10am, 1.30pm - 2.45, 4pm -6 (4hrs 15mins))**
2. **what did i do** - did some basic research into tiled and map creation. watched a video on this. tried to create a test map using tiled and importing it into vs code to use as a map. currently the sizing is a bit weird but will try figure that out later in the day or another day. tried some time finding sprites and then attempting to create the animations for these 
3. **what didnt work/struggled with** - today i struggled with the animation of the character sprites. the sheet the tutorial used had all directions on one sprit sheet where i have multiple sheets. i manged to make some progress on this issue, by flipping the sprite but it still looks super jenk....
4. **notes for tomorrow - re watch the animation video, maybe make a bigger map (maybe rewatch map vid), and potentially slow down the player speed. potentiallly use a different sprite sheet the has multi direction assests to make animation appear smoother. add git ignore to game structure if you didnt yesterday. re watch the camera vid and try fix the zoom in stuff. half way through camera centering vid**

Day Four (23/7/25)
1. **Time spent working (10.30-12, 4pm-5.15 )**
**what did i do** - did some research into procedural map generation with love2d and tiled - decided agaisnt this for now as it is way above my knowledge. decided to stick with creating maps manually for now at a smaller scale.
played around with different sprites and tried to get animations for movement working.
2. **what didnt work/struggled with** - today i continued to struggle with animating my charater sprite.
3. **what i learnt** - i learnt i should really read and listen more carefully as the sprite sheet dimensions for the sheet i was using were on the website the whole time...

4. **notes for tomorrow** - SET UP GIT IGNORE AND START MAKING BRANCHES, CONTINUE TO WORK ON SPRTE ANIMATION and use git daily...

***Took some time of for Prep recovery***

Day Five (29/07/25)
1. **Time spent working (10.30- )**
2. **what did i do** - added some more key bindings for playing movement (WASD).

**Total time spent = 8 hours~**
